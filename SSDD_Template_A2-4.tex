\section[INTRODUCTION]{\selectlanguage{english}\bfseries\color{black}
INTRODUCTION}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
The purpose of this document is to describe the architectural components of secure internet instant 
messaging system and the supported functionalities of each component, security features, 
threat model, and attacks considered in a complete and concise manner. 
The internet instant messaging system supports authentication of its users, 
confidentiality of the messages and data exchanged between users, and 
verification of the integrity of messages and data exchanged between its users. 
This document will describe in general how users log into the system, establish
 sessions with other users, and how the system provides integrity and confidentiality 
 of message transfers between users as well as any other assumption that 
 have been made in the design of the implementation for the internet instant 
 messaging system. \ }

\subsection{DOCUMENT OVERVIEW}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection shall provide an overview of the organization of this
SSDD.}

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
Section 2 of this document describes the system and software
architecture from the developer and user viewpoint. \ }

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
Section 3 provides a detailed description of the threat model considered 
in the security protocol design. \ }

{\selectlanguage{english}\color{black}
Section 4 provides a detailed description of the design of the software supported
functionalities as well as the data structures required for implementation
of supported functions that contribute to the implementation of the overall
system and software architectural entities and components.  \ }

\clearpage\pagestyle{Standard}
\section[SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE
ARCHITECTURE]{\selectlanguage{english}\bfseries\color{black} SYSTEM AND
SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This section of the document shall describe with detail every component of the system as well as the relationship
and interface between them. These architectural components, when
integrated together as specified within this document, shall implement
all functions performed by the system in response to an input or in
support of an output as described by the project requirements specification.
All architectural components shall: be uniquely identifiable, be well described,
have clear responsibilities, have well specified interfaces, and have
well described interactions with other architectural entities. \ }

\subsection{CLIENT}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document shall describe in detail the component that represents
a client in the system. A client consists of identification information such as IP address, port
for TCP stream socket connection to the server and other clients, as well a buddy list that contains a
list of possible clients that each client may establish a session with via the session interface. Each client
will have a shared session key with the server and other clients for confidential and 
integrity protected message transfer. \ }

\subsection{SERVER}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document shall describe in detail the component that represents the
server in the system. The server is responsible for providing each client its buddy list,
, authentication each client via the login interface the session key for each client after log in authentication has been performed, and a ticket
for communication between end users that includes a shared session key among the end users. \ }

\subsection{LOGIN INTERFACE}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document shall describe in detail the component in which
clients log into the system. The login interface should handle the authentication of client
trying to connect to the server and enter the system. Once authenticated, the client should
be directed to the session interface to allow a session to be established between the server and
client. \ }
 
 \subsection{SESSION INTERFACE}
 {\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
 This subsection of the document shall describe the component that handles
 establishing a session between two clients. The session interface is responsible for establishing
 a shared session key between the clients and server as well as between clients themselves. From
 the sessions keys, encryption and authentication keys will be derived for client to client
 message transfers. This will allow confidentiality and integrity of the messages being transferred. \ }
 
\subsection{BUDDY LIST}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document shall describe the component that allows a client
to establish a session with other clients in the system. The buddy list contains detailed
information about each client in the system such as IP address, TCP stream socket port number
and availability status. \ }

\subsection{CLIENT ACCOUNT DATABASE}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document shall describe the component that securely stores client identification
information. This information is used by the login interface to authenticate each client in the system. client information 
consists of username, SHA512 hash of password, salt associated with the password hash, IP address, last login timestamp, 
unique identification number (maybe), and the current shared session key with the server.\ }

\section{THREAT MODEL}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black} 
This section of the document should describe with detail the potential threats
and risks considered for the system described in this document. Security features,
threat ranking, assets, attacks considered, countermeasures 
and mitigation will be identified, quantified, and addressed in a complete 
and detailed manner. \ }
 
\subsection{THREAT IDENTIFICATION}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document describes the threats
considered and identified during the design of the system referenced
in this document. Threats correspond to outside entities that are considered
malicious or a danger to the integrity, privacy, and functionality of the system. \ }

\subsection{THREAT RANKING}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document ranks the threats identified in THREAT IDENTIFICATION
 from the perspective of risk factors. \ }

\subsection{ENTRY POINTS}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document defines the interfaces through which an attacker
can interact with the system or supply it data. \ }

\subsection{ASSETS}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document identifies and lists the resources/items
of interest to an attacker. Assets can be both physical and abstract. \ }

\subsection{ATTACKS CONSIDERED}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document lists any attacks considered during the
assessment and identification of potential threats and against the security
protocols described in SECURITY FEATURES.
\ }

\subsection{SECURITY FEATURES}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection of the document lists and describes the provided security
controls and policies to mitigate or prevent the threats and attacks identified in 
THREAT IDENTIFICATION and ATTACKS CONSIDERED.

\clearpage\pagestyle{Standard}
\section{SOFTWARE DETAILED DESIGN}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This section of the document should describe with detail the design of
the software being described in this document. This
section shall specify the following supported functions that correspond to the
relevant architectural components: CLIENT, SERVER, CLIENT ACCOUNT DATABASE,
LOGIN INTERFACE, SESSION INTERFACE, and BUDDY LIST as well as 
how the security features mentioned in SECURITY FEATURES are implemented
to provide authentication of clients, message integrity, and message transfer
confidentiality. \ }

\subsection{DATA DICTIONARY}
{\selectlanguage{english}\itshape\color{black}
This subsection shall list and describe all the data and data structures
defined and/or used by the components and entities specified above. 
For each data item or structure indicate where it is defined,
referenced, and modified.}
